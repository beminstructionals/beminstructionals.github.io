    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>Where can I get help?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://unmethours.com/questions/" target="_blank">UnmetHours.com</a> is an excellent resource. Questions and answers are posted by full time staff, developers, and users on many specific modeling questions. Chances are, you can find what you need there or you can ask your well documented question and get an answer in a day or two.</p>
    
    <h2>How do I adjust the IDF Editor page?</h2>
    <p>That can be done by modifying the <code>top_height=30</code> and <code>bottom_height=60</code> URL parameters, which determine the heights of documentation and table sections as a percentage of the total screen height. Just change the 30 and 60 after <code>top_height=</code> and <code>bottom_height=</code> in the URL to whatever you want.</p>
    
    <h2>Why are some objects not displayed in the Geometry?</h2>
    <p>The short answer is correctly implementing every object type in 3D space was too much work. Most of the objects are too special purpose as well and can be made using a more versatile object.</p>
    <p>IDF objects that will display in the Geometry are <code>BuildingSurface:Detailed FenestrationSurface:Detailed Shading:Site:Detailed Shading:Building:Detailed Shading:Zone:Detailed Daylighting:ReferencePoint</code> objects.</p>
    <p>IDF objects that will NOT display in the Geometry are <code>GeometryTransform Wall:Detailed RoofCeiling:Detailed Floor:Detailed Wall:Exterior Wall:Adiabatic Wall:Underground Wall:Interzone Roof Ceiling:Adiabatic Ceiling:Interzone Floor:GroundContact Floor:Adiabatic Floor:Interzone Window Door GlazedDoor Window:Interzone Door:Interzone GlazedDoor:Interzone Shading:Site Shading:Building Shading:Overhang Shading:Overhang:Projection Shading:Fin Shading:Fin:Projection</code> objects.</p>
    <p>I do think some of the <code>Shading:*</code> objects not currently implemented would be very nice to have, but they are all very complicated to implement because they must take into account the handedness of the vertex ordering, Relative versus World coordinates, referencing multiple object types, et cetera. Some of them also have ambiguous placement, like on a triangular window, placement on slanted surfaces, et cetera. I tried looking in the source code, but I either couldn't find the relevant code or the code was incomprehensible. If anyone wants to take on the Herculean task of reverse engineering how these objects are placed and then modifying the website javascript, be my guest.</p>

    <h2>Why is the Geometry page not working correctly?</h2>
    <p>This is most likely due to a missing or malformed object in the IDF. Do you have exactly one <code>Building</code> object? Do you have exactly one <code>GlobalGeometryRules</code> object? Are your <code>Zone, ZoneList, BuildingSurface:Detailed, FenestrationSurface:Detailed</code>, et cetera objects formed correctly? Did you mistakently use a <code>Shading:Site:*</code> versus <code>Shading:Building:*</code> object, which use different coordinate systems? Are any of the points in your surfaces not coplanar with the other points? Are you using Relative or World coordinates? Do your <code>Zone</code> objects have the correct origin?</p>
    <p>A good way to find most of these errors is to simulate your IDF and look in the resulting *.ERR file, which is usually pretty good about pointing out missing or malformed objects. The *.ERR file might specify more <code>Output:*</code> objects to display more verbose output as well.</p>
    
    <h2>Why on Earth did you make this?</h2>
    <p>The real reason was so the misses and I wouldn't figuratively murder each other while being couped up during the pandemic. I also enjoy teaching and remember how steep the learning curve for this stuff was, so making this site and the vidoes that go with it seemed like a good idea.</p>
    
    <h2>How do I report a bug?</h2>
    <p>Thank you for reporting the bug. Please send relevant information, such as screenshots, the IDF, browser, order of operations to cause the error, et cetera to bem.instructionals@gmail.com and I'll do my best. I'll try to fix the bug if it's something I made, but may just pass along the bug on UnmetHours.com or github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues if the bug is from deeper within the software.</p>
